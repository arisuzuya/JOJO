            <h2>Araki's Unique Art Style</h2>
            <p>One of the most distinctive features of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is Hirohiko Araki's evolving art style. From the muscular heroes of the early parts to the more fashion-forward and slender designs in later arcs, Araki's love for high fashion and classical art is evident throughout the series.</p>
            <p>Araki is famous for his dramatic character poses, which have become iconic in pop culture. These "JoJo poses" are often imitated by fans and referenced in other media, and have become a signature element of the series.</p>
